ACE Fitting Notebook

This Jupyter notebook performs fitting of Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) models to training datasets generated by MACE or other methods.

Purpose

Automates ACE model setup, training, and evaluation for benchmarking accuracy and efficiency.

Main Steps

Load dataset: Reads .xyz files containing structures, energies, and forces.

Define basis & hyperparameters: Sets cutoff, body order, and polynomial degree.

Train model: Fits the ACE potential using least-squares solvers (e.g., RRQR).

Validate: Computes RMSE/MAE for energies and forces.

Save results: Exports trained model and performance metrics.

Output

Trained ACE potential (.json) and results file summarizing errors and timing for benchmarking.
