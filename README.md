# Knowledge Distillation from Foundation Models for ML Interatomic Potentials

This repository contains the code, Jupyter notebooks, and datasets developed for my Master’s thesis:
**“Knowledge Distillation from Foundation Models for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials.”**

The project explores how predictive knowledge from the MACE foundation model can be distilled into linear Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) models to achieve comparable accuracy at lower computational cost. The repository includes:
- MACE-based molecular dynamics dataset generation scripts  
- RVD and RRR data-augmentation workflows  
- ACE fitting and hyperparameter sweeps  
- Benchmarking scripts for tungsten, molybdenum, and niobium  
- Analysis notebooks and plotting utilities
